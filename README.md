The Book Share app features a clean and minimalistic authentication interface with a focus on readability and simplicity. Both the Sign Up and Sign In screens follow a consistent visual style using a white background and dark blue accent color (#000080) to establish brand identity.

Icon & Branding:
A simple open-book icon placed at the top reinforces the app’s purpose, paired with the bold title “Book Share” in blue for clear visual hierarchy.

Form Fields:
Rounded input boxes with soft borders maintain a user-friendly and approachable design. Placeholders guide users through required information such as name, email, and password.

Buttons:
Primary buttons (“Sign up” and “Sign in”) use a deep blue background with white bold text, creating strong contrast for visibility and accessibility. A subtle shadow adds depth.

Alternative Sign-in:
A Google sign-in button provides a modern, quick-access authentication option, outlined with Google’s signature colors for instant recognition.

Navigation Texts:
Supporting links like “Remember me,” “Forget Password,” and “Sign In/Sign Up” are neatly positioned and styled in blue for clear interactivity cues.

Overall Layout:
The screens are centered and well-balanced with generous spacing, ensuring a clean, modern look that enhances user focus and ease of navigation.
