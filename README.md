**Analysis of Existing Design (Before Redesign)**

**1. Visual Design & Layout**

Problem: The homepage looks cluttered, with too many sections packed together.
Problem: Outdated visual aesthetics (flat design, inconsistent spacing, dense text).
Problem: Banners and ads distract users from the main booking section.
What works: It still maintains the Indian Railways identity and highlights multiple travel options.

**2. Navigation**

Problem: Navigation bar is overloaded with too many text-based links, making it hard for users to find what they need quickly.
Problem: No clear separation between primary (Book Ticket) and secondary (Explore, Holidays) tasks.
What works: Presence of “Help & Support,” “Login/Register,” and “IRCTC eWallet” are useful, just not well organized.

**3. Buttons & Call to Actions (CTAs)**

Problem: Buttons (like “Book Ticket” or “Search”) are not visually distinct — similar size and color to other UI elements.
Problem: No consistent button style (different sizes, fonts, and colors used).
What works: “Book Ticket” function is clearly available on the homepage.

**4. Typography & Color**

Problem: Font hierarchy is inconsistent — headings, body text, and links look similar.
Problem: Colors clash slightly (blue, red, black, and white mixed inconsistently).
What works: Use of Indian Railways blue color maintains brand recognition.

**5. Information Architecture**

Problem: Too much information displayed at once — packages, banners, alerts, etc.
Problem: User journey (search → select train → book → payment) is not visually guided.
What works: Inclusion of multiple services (flights, hotels, catering, etc.) in one place.

✅ Hero section features a high-quality train image, instantly showing brand identity.

**3. Enhanced Button Visibility**

✅ Buttons (like “Search”) now use contrasting color (blue) and consistent rounded shape.
